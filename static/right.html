            It’s essential to consider the quality of the produce when growing and harvesting it. From the farm to the table, food is rigorously monitored at 
            every step of the process. One of the most important steps in the process takes place at the farm, where food is grown and cultivated carefully by 
            farmers. In the interest of public health and federal law, farmers need to make sure their crops pass laws and are suitable for consumption. One 
            possible way is through the use of smart sanitization. The crucial part of this smart sanitization allows produce to retain it’s fresh taste while 
            being sanitized. In most cases, such produce lose flavor are being subject to intense cleaning. With this technology, it will attract more customers 
            to try the crops or products made. As a farmer, one of the biggest concerns that come to mind is making a profit as well as the quality of crops that 
            are being sold. With precision agriculture, these problems are less of a pain to deal with. This is due to the fact that technology such as the use of 
            drones will allow more data gathering each day. It allows farmers to react quickly to problems that may be present such as poor soil quality or pests 
            in a certain sector of the farm. Not only does it save time, but money as well. The investment into technology here will pay itself over time. 
            Considering the usefulness of precision agriculture technology, it’s highly recommended to invest in IoT devices, Internet of Things for short. 
            According to a post on Forbes, there are several devices already developed and being tested on farms. For example, there is a FitBit for cows that 
            monitors their health. If there is an issue, farm workers can be easily notified and respond to the issue. Another device involves water use. A company 
            called CropX uses sensors to detect soil quality to make sure it is sustainable. This makes it once again easier for farmers to manage. Thus, it will 
            save money and help out farmers in the long run by reallocating farm work and resources to another area such as packaging or inspecting produce.
