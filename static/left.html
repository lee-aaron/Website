            It is important to understand the people who are getting your produce. 
            Since they will be the ones buying your products, it’s also necessary to understand their likes and dislikes in food whether it be quality or representation. 
            According to Roni Neff, director of the food system environmental sustainability and public health program at John Hopkins University, she claims that a lot 
            of food waste happens due to perception from customers. This means that consumers are looking for “perfect looking” food. They see that ugly looking produce 
            may have some defects and are not suitable for consumption despite the fact that they completely are. In order to combat this, it is important to simply find
            ways to reduce the production of such looking crops. Even if such produce are made, there are ways to still reduce the food loss on the farm due to bad looks 
            before shipping to markets. One important way is to connect with local organizations who specialize in redistributing food to those who want them. Farmers 
            will not need to worry about the amount of food loss they are impacted by as it will help them reduce the wastage on the farm. Furthermore, another possible 
            solution is for farmers to focus on gathering crop health data. According to Beausanga, a PhD student researching food waste, she states how farmers associate
            food waste with weather and pests more because they’re the root of the problem. Yield and profit is more of a concern for farmers as it correlates with the 
            farm’s produce. She notes that while redistribution of surplus crops is in place, better data gathering to target crop utilization is a good place to start. 
            This means that by reducing the number of crops lost to uncontrollable effects such as pests and weather, it will turn more yield to the farmer. To accomplish 
            such a task will allow the scientific community to explore better methods and routes for better crop yield and less loss.
